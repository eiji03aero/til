## What is Nx?
- is a tool to provide better developer experience dealing with monorepo.
- nx workspace consists of:
  - apps: the applications
  - libs: shared codes. should define apis to expose carefully for better isolation
  - tools: code to run against codebase, or scripts against external dependency like db
  - workspace.json: define project living in workspace
  - nx.json: extra information about projects, like restricting relationships between dependencies
- nx has a configuration file that exist in both:
  - root of workspace
  - each applications
- out of the box support for development tools
  - unit testing: jest
  - e2e testing: cypress
  - linter: eslint
- computation caching
  - caching computation result (like build, testing) improves overall performance
    - eg) faster build, testing, cli functionality (eg. generate component)
  - has a support with cloud which is accessible for anyone in the team
- work smartly based on dependency analysis
  - building sequentially based on dependency graph
  - run a test
  - can consider current code change as well

## Why Nx?
- benefit of monorepo
  - shared code:
    - validation logic, ui components, types
  - atomic changes:
    - one commit/PR to update cross-cutting feature
  - developer mobility:
    - easier to define shared methods for operations like spin up local, run test, so that
      the boundary among teams can be lowered
  - single set of dependencies:
    - if dependency versions are aligned across projects, would be easier for long-term maintenance,
      since there is only one version to care, instead of figuring out different problems from different versions.
      plus there would be less possibility of having conflict coming from different verion
  - why no code collocation?
    - ineffective operation cost
      - no optimization for building, testing
    - no code boundaries
    - inconsistent tooling
      - isn't this same with polyrepo?
- while lerna and yarn workspaces help installation part of development, they are not really support for monorepo-application development style
- what Nx can provide:
  - scaling repository
    - faster command execution
      - make use of computation caching, and dependency analysis
  - scaling your organization
    - controlled code sharing
      - code ownership support
    - consistent code generation
      - have a generator which can be run interactively to generate code
    - accurate architecture diagram
      - since Nx analyzes component dependencies, it can generate architecture diagram (!!)

## misc
  - importing existing repository while preserving git history

# Thoughts
- clear benefits stated, why not go for this one instead of reinventing the wheel along the way?
