# Summary
- Summariesgo2 is expected to add more features to error handling
- until then, what this article suggests is:
  - for cases which do not require stacktrace, utilize standard errors package
    - errors.Errorf to wrap error
    - errors.Is to handle errors based on type
  - for cases which do require stacktrace, utilize pkg/errors package
    - errors.WithStack to add stacktrace where you want to retrieve
    - errors.Wrap to add stacktrace on anywhere you want to trace stack
- about pkg/errors
  - this is not actively developed any more, as its purpose was fulfilled by go2 to introduce those additional features
- about xerrors
  - this is deprecated. do not use it
