# Netflix OSS and Spring Boot â€” Coming Full Circle
https://netflixtechblog.com/netflix-oss-and-spring-boot-coming-full-circle-4855947713a0

---

# Summary
- Netflix used develop backend/mid-tier software components internally (eg. load balancer, service discovery).
- However, around 2018, they decided to migrate over to the spring-framework based ecosystem.
- This is because Netflix thought spring framework provides enough functionality for their needs.

# Content
## Netflix's software development in early days
- in 2007, they started develop applications on cloud.
- To support it, they built number of libraries:
  - Ribbon: load balancing
  - Eureka: service dicovery
  - Histrix: fault tolerance
  - Governor: dependency injection
  - Archaius: configuration
- in 2015, Spring Cloud Netlifx reached version 1.0. this is a community-driven project which ties the Netflix's opensource softwares together.
- in 2018, Netflix decided to adopt this community project as their core ecosystem to build software

# Thoughts
- Was there any trouble with specifying java as core language to develop?
  - seems to be it is the solo language they use to build backend components.
