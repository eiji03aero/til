## basics
### ACID
- https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/acid-properties-in-dbms/
- https://www.bmc.com/blogs/acid-atomic-consistent-isolated-durable/
- four factors that make transaction operations consistent.
- Atomicity
  - meaning certain transaction happens completely or not at all
    - involves two operations:
      - Commit
      - Abort
  - is also known as `all or nothing rule`
- Consistent
  - meaning integrity constraints must be maintained, so that before and after transaction, database is consistent
  - when constraints are violated, the transaction should be rolled back
- Isolation
  - meaning allow multiple transactions can happen concurrently without affecting each other
- Durability
  - meaning that once transaction is committed, it has to be guranteed data is written to disk (somewhere memory with persistency)
