# What is Microservices?

# Summary
## what is microservices architecture?
- it is a system architecutre where splits entire system into multiple orchestrated components with high modularity
  - components should be focused as single-function. single responsibility
  - components should be autonomous. they should be able to work on their own
- no single definition for it. implementation could vary depending on team/organization

## background where microservices was born
- enterprise used to develop systems in a way known as monolithic application
  - one component to manage all functionality for business use
- but it had some notable problems:
  - inefficient system operations
    - even one small change needs whole application to build/deploy
  - lower availability
    - even one small bug could take the entire system down
  - tightly coupled codebase
    - easier to leak business logic anywhere
  - given more and more development teams/orgs starting to adopt agile/devops, faster development cycle was necessary
- to address the above problems, enterprise develpment teams started adopting microservices

## benefits of microservices:
- simpler deployment
- simpler codebase
- reusable functionality across business
- better fault-tolerance
- smaller risk of change in technology stack
  - unlike monolith, it's easier to update stack, since codebase is smaller

## characteristics of microservices
- mutliple components
  - system is split into multiple components, usually based on business capabilities/boundaries
  - this contributes to better operability/maintainability
    - easier deployment, making update, redeploy
  - downsides of this aspect
    - expensive remote calls compared to in-process called in monolithic
    - additional complexity derived from distributed system
- built for business
  - unlike: monolitich system approach where each team have specific focused responsibility (like database, technology, infrastructure ...)
  - it is: each team has responsibility on a product which makes them to own multiple services. focus could be cross-cutting
- simple routing
  - unlike: ESBs where message routing/pipelining has more complexity
  - it is: simpler mechanism to routing/pipelining messages
- decentralized
  - each service tend to have its own databases
- failure resistent
  - since system is split into multiple independent component, it has higher resisbility:
    - even if one component is down, others still can provide functionalities
- evolutionary
  - with its distributed system nature, it can develop the architecture more flexibly

## pros and cons of microservices
- pros:
  - gives ownership to each service/team which leads to autonomous higher development velocity
  - easier to develop codebase based on nature of business
  - better fault tolerance
  - no long-term commitment to one technology stack
- cons:
  - hardships derived from nature of distributed system
    - for some cases, deployment has to be done along with dependencies
    - some testing case could be harder
    - additional complexity to realize business logic which spans across services
    - have to implement mechanism for messaging between services

## how microservices works
- monoliths and conway's law
  - conway's law says:
    - organization design systems are constrained to produce designs which are copies of the communication structures of these organizations
  - problems with monoliths
    - when codebase grows larger, it would be harder to have concurrent developments on same piece of code over cross-purpose
      - will have additional cost of communicating to find drop-off place to establish logic that satisfies both needs
      - when hiring more developers, this is more of a case
    - need to triage tasks based on priority
      - when there are multiple urgent tasks to complete, it is not always the case that they can solve them timely
        - one task needs to deploy asap, while another task cannot be dealt with because of lack of time/resource
- microservices: avoiding the monoliths
  - one way to avoid monoliths is find a portion of application in application graph, which can easily be extracted out
    - ex) class which does not have dependency to other part of application (Printer, Storage)
- service objects and identifying data
  - begin to structure/refactor portion of application as if it were completely external
    - define service object for one specific purpose, consolidate all the related features into it
- coordination and dumb pipes
  - accodring to the article, microservice implements low-level apis, which can be piped together to achieve complex logic with flexibility
  - on the other hand, traditional SOA implements high-level api which could cause duplication of logic, low modularity in logic

## SOA vs microservices
- actually they have not a few similarities
  - people have different opinion if microservices and SOA are kind of same thing
- argued differences:
  - messaging pattern
    - SOA: more imperative, smart approach to leverage pipelining
    - ms: more declarative, dumb approach to leverage pipelining
  - message tool
    - SOA: tend to require specific ESBs (enterprise service bus)
    - ms: no specification, tend to adopt faster messaing mechanisms
  - programming style
    - SOA: imperative
    - ms: declarative/reactive

# Thoughts
- about the coordination and dumb pipes section
  - is this implementing ms's nature of implementing low-level apis a property of microservices?
  - isn't this just a matter of architecting and implementation detail?
  - but given microservice is basically defined to be single-function-ed, probably this is the case
