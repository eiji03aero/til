# Difference between View and Materialized View in Database or SQL?
https://www.java67.com/2012/11/what-is-difference-between-view-vs-materialized-view-database-sql.html

---

# Summary
- View and Materialized View works for a similar purpose, such as providing a mechanism to create copied logical table from other existing tables.
- However, while View is not persisted to disk, MV is persisted on disk. Thus they are selected for different reasons.

# Content
## What is View?
- View is a logical virtual table created by select query, but the result is not saved on disk.
- Thus every time View is referenced, the select query is run, and get the latest data.

## What is Materialized View in database?
- Materialized View works just like View, but it does save the result of query on disk.

## Difference between the two
- whether it saves the result on disk or not.
- while View holds same rowid as the original table, MV doesn't
- while View always get latest data, MV needs refresh to fetch latest data.
- MV has better performance, since it basically caches select query result
