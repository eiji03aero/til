# Gotchas
- Using View and Flex was too inconvenient for styling
    - want to define flex and padding and border in one setting
- Styling code gets redundant and complicates component code
    ```
        <View
          key={name}
          padding="size-100"
          borderColor="dark"
          borderWidth="thin"
          borderRadius="small"
          width="size-325"
          height="size-325"
        >
          <Flex
            width="100%"
            height="100%"
            direction="column"
            alignItems="center"
          >
            <Icon name={name} size="L" />
            <Text>{name}</Text>
          </Flex>
        </View>
    ```
- How do I define text with custom styles ... ?
    - typography is on the way (said so in 2020 ... lol)
    - had to implement custom text component which utilizes existing css asset

# Goodies
- Styling will be at ease as choise is pretty much limited
    - At first this limitation felt really annoying as I could not bring out full capacity of css.
    - However, as I use more of these components, this limitation felt more right for team development.
    - Limiting choise leads to some aspects:
        - Not much to leverage when styling thus the quality should be aligned and go up
        - No need to use so much resource of your brain muscle as there is only a few choices
