# Adding routing functionality to til website
- The ticket like article to describe the process of adding routing functionality.

---

# Problems
- 1. User cannot directly open specific article through url.
- 2. Links do not utilize href, thus lower accessibility
  - for now, we just put the fragment to href attribute
  - js handles page-navigation-ish process
  - user cannot open links in new tab, copy link ... etc
- 3. Kind of hard to organize which route to show what

---

# Solutions
## Draft ideas
### 1. Introduce finer-grained component system
- For Problems.3, by having better component system, we could oganize the codebase better.
- ideas
  - [nope] make all the component functions async
    - so that they can take care of their own concern before
    - provides:
      - base class, which defines set of default implementations
        - render (props): Promise<string>;
    - this won't take me any further. component-oriented system is not a piece-of-cake thing
  - [like it] go with custom elements
    - this way:
      - can see how far this method could go
      - basically no external tools that we need

### 2. Introduce functionality to handle routing
- This handles Problems.1 and 2, meaning
  - user can

## Consideration
- Just want to get done with this as quick as possible.
  - got better things to do!
- Seemingly Prolblems.1,2 are the must ones

## Conclusion
- Just deal with Problems.1,2
- Not gonna do anything with 3 for now, because it might take a while, as:
  - I might want to dig deeper into web components and framework around it
- I do not have time for these shit

# Requirements
## External
- User can open page with certain content by specifying url path.
  - What to be specified would be:
    - /posts/[blabla].md ... posts pages
    - / ... top welcome page
    - [not planned yet] ... search post page
- User sees the url changes based on the content shown at the moment.
  - So that user can easily interact/utilze with the page (copy url, bookmark, even google crawler thing?)

## Internal
- for links (anchor element) used in the website:
  - should be given href to corresponding path
  - onclick to handle logic
    - if modified (click with command key?)
      - return
    - e.preventDefault();
    - trigger page navigation logic with path
- application service to implement page navigation logic (path: string)
  - do path matching to generate page content, embed the content
    - top page => composite content for welcome
    - posts pages => load corresponding content
    - not found => show not found thingy
      - probably with 404 ascii art?
  - location replaceState with path
- on initial load of page:
  - call the page navigation logic with the current path

---

# Development plan
- [x] implement navigation logic
  - should define route mapping
  - should implement view components
- [x] implement utility function to wrap navigation links
  - should return string with folloing attributes:
    - href ... path
    - onclick ... bind navigation logic function
- [x] apply navigation link
- [x] apply initial load thing

---

# Scribbles
- create anchor element utility
  - accepts href
  - returns strings of:
    - href=given href
    - onclick=navigation handler (event, href)
- navigation handler
  - if event is modified
    - early exit to allow browser native functionality (open in new tab)
  - call path navigation handler on service
- replaceState to reflect page url
- if unknown path is specified, show 404 page
