# Implementation patterns

## Builder pattern for creating complex data structure
- https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/builder/go/example
- It is sometimes difficult to handle struct as an argument passed to function which requires complex input.
  - Because golang has some difficulties around zero-value vs default-value when creating struct, the function cannot tell if struct field value is a zero-value or the one explicitly set.
- To overcome above problem, we could introduce builder pattern.
- Implementation requirement would be:
  - Define a struct which groups the required values together
  - This struct:
    - Sets default values as required in New function
    - Holds the values as private fields
    - Exposes getter and setter methods for each fields
- Bonus for adopting this pattern would be:
  - Easier to add validation for each fields, or combination of fields
