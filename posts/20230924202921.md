# Notes
## Next.js
- client component seems to get SSR-ed
    - thus initial html would have the rendering result
- What are the motivations to use server components?
    - resolve request waterfall
    - fetch data with smaller latency
    - hide sensitive data like api token from client code
    - make the js file chunk smaller by running certain code / library on server

## Architecture
### Basic usage
- initial query params logic can be extracted to server component

### deneb-react
- integrate app directory and views
    - with this way, we can leave the responsibility of separating client vs server components in views (app) layer

## Tailwind
- cannot use :not?
