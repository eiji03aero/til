# Versions

## v18

### automatic batching
- for fewer rendering when multiple state changes are triggered
  - React has been doing this already
    - eg) two setstate in one eventhandler leads to one rendering
  - however, the batching behavior was kind of unstable
    - React used to batch the updates only triggered in browser events
      eg) eventhandler > promise call > inside then callback, calling updates
- this update attempts to make automatic batching better
- React will batch all the state updates automatically
  - this can be opt-out by using flushSync api

### Updates in Suspense behavior
- legacy suspense
  - mounts and triggers effects for sibling components of Suspended components
- concurrent suspense
  - DOES NOT mount and trigger effects for sibling components of Suspended components

### Concurrent features
#### startTransition
- tell React the updates wrapped in this api are not urgent, so that it can prioritize other updates
  - eg) typing in input, updating both input field and some UI depending on the input, and wants to prioritize input update
- useTransition hook provides value to indicate if transition is pending

#### useDefferedValue
- no info atm

#### SuspenseList
- takes array of Suspense components, and control the order of rendering them
  - eg) wants to render 10 component of cards that respectively do some request from top to bottom
- this is to deal with cululative layout shift

#### Streaming SSR selective hydration

  - UI is not crucial to product, but data and logic are.
  - where to write business logic?
    - in container component?
      - no
      - two reasons
        - now business is coupled with UI
        - now business logic is married with framework
          - is part of React realm

  - react components best practices
  - name your components
    - helps devtool and reading stack trace
    - helps completion on editor
  - try to define component with less props
    - would be harder to read/maintain if component has a lot of props to take care of

  - readyfor-san thoughs on react frontend architectural planning
  - should use redux?
    - one criteria would be:
      - yes ... if frontend has complicated presentational logic
      - no ... else
  - redux has advantages like
    - handle complicated logic and state management
    - better usability for integration test
      - with cypress, you can test with just firing actions to see if expected UI is shown
    - minimizing the range of incluence (selector, connect's memoization)
  - structuring redux store
    - to separate concerns better
      - group them into four categories. each can depend on the modules above than itself (like subscribing for actions)

# State management patterns

- https://blog.logrocket.com/modern-guide-react-state-patterns/

  - as application grows, state management becomes harder
    - prop drilling through multiple layers of components
    - have to juggle ownership of state by lifting it up among ancestors
    - unnecessary re-renders
  - redux is the prominent and most popular tool to solve state management hardships
  - react hooks api provides basic functionality around state management
  - state machine tool like XState helps by providing stricter state-machines which gives better predictability

- https://qiita.com/SoraKumo/items/6267133940c15c89481e
  - problems on useState
    - it combines three responsibilitires:
      - create and hold state
      - updates state
      - provides current state
    - these leads to problems:
      - component holds state always have to re-render when state change
      - the higher component is in tree, the more chances to causes unnecessary re-renders in itself and descendent components
