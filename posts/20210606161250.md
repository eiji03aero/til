# Versions

### automatic batching
- for fewer rendering when multiple state changes are triggered
    - React has been doing this already
        - eg) two setstate in one eventhandler leads to one rendering
    - however, the batching behavior was kind of unstable
        - React used to batch the updates only triggered in browser events
        - eg) eventhandler > promise call > inside then callback, calling updates
- this update attempts to make automatic batching better
- React will batch all the state updates automatically
    - this can be opt-out by using flushSync api

### Updates in Suspense behavior
- legacy suspense
    - mounts and triggers effects for sibling components of Suspended components
- concurrent suspense
    - DOES NOT mount and trigger effects for sibling components of Suspended components

### Concurrent features
#### startTransition
- tell React the updates wrapped in this api are not urgent, so that it can prioritize other updates
    - eg) typing in input, updating both input field and some UI depending on the input, and wants to prioritize input update
- useTransition hook provides value to indicate if transition is pending

#### useDefferedValue
- no info atm

#### SuspenseList
- takes array of Suspense components, and control the order of rendering them
    - eg) wants to render 10 component of cards that respectively do some request from top to bottom
- this is to deal with cululative layout shift

#### Streaming SSR selective hydration

# Styling

## css-in-js comparison
- emotion, styled-components

# Testing

- https://qiita.com/nnishimura/items/521af77125d2b7ad49c5
    - enzyme or react testing library?

---

# Library

## Next.js
https://nextjs.org/

### Why Next.js?
Out-of-the-box support for production/development concerns:

- Image size optimization
- Code bundling
- Code splitting
- Hybrid SSG and SSR
- Incremental Static Regeneration support
    - For large (10k~ pages) static content support
- Development support
    - Dev server (hot, live reload)
- File-system routing (under pages directory)
- Optional:
    - ability to implement api endpoints
        - isn't this for only when SSR-ing (has a execution env)?

# Thoughts
## React
### useEffect's dependency array
- I think this dependency has 2 responsibilities (or at least how people see it):
  - 1. Mark the dependencies so that useEffect could run at an appropriate condition
    - to optimize when to run
    - to capture the referenced dependencies properly
  - 2. Hook into a condition when you want to run the logic.
- By not perceiving the difference of these two, the code base could get more complicated or prone to errors.
- Idea to address this would be:
  - 1. Extract the the responsibility.2 to inside the logic.
    - Explicitly control when it should run
    - But it would be cumbersome and hard to keep it among team.
