# MonorepoとOneTeamでMicroservicesの課題に挑む
https://speakerdeck.com/dena_tech/techcon2021-4

# Summary
- product is:
  - health kind of application
  - hybrid web application
  - architecture
    - client applications
      - web
      - native mobile app
    - bff for each client
    - backend in microservice
- problems
  - inefficient communication between BE and infrastructure team
  - increasing number of repositories
    - in polyrepo
    - each service has its own architecture/taste of coding
      - makes code review harder
    - higher maintenance cost
      - language/library upgrading
      - have to setup infrastructure for new repositories
- solutions
  - unite BE and infra team
  - polyrepo to monorepo
- monorepo
  - defined fixed directory structure
    - consolidate pacakges based on purpose (e2e, microservice-implementation...)
    - benefits:
      - easier management of shared process (test, building docker image)
  - abstract implementation of microservice
    - the concrete microservice implements certain interface
      - has methods like:
        - start server
        - stop server
- monolithic or micreservice
  - monolithic should always be one of choice to consider
