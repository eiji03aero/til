## Project based
### [othello](https://github.com/eiji03aero/othello)

I worked on this mostly because I wanted to try out almin which is client-isde DDD implementation.

### [kuzen-web](https://github.com/eiji03aero/kuzen-web)

This repository tried a lot of things:

    - Separates packages baesd on domains/features
- Implements various methods to separte React and logic
    - Hexagonal with apollo client (web)
    - Hexagonal without external libs (mash-editor)
- Implements vim clone which works on web
- Implements terminal-emulator-ish widget (mash-term)
    - Heavily inspired by xterm

### [react-hexagonal-sample](https://github.com/eiji03aero/react-hexagonal-sample)
An attempt to implement React application with core logics isolated from React components.

### [heaxagon](https://github.com/eiji03aero/hexagon)
This is an attempt to implement framework that I have always wanted for developing React application.  
This is still ongoing (not even sure if I will really complete, but I'm currently planning to).
