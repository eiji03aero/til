# Natural numbers
- 自然数
- positive integers
- symbol: N
- {1,2,3,4,5 ...}

# Whole numbers
- 整数
- positive integers and 0
- symbol: W
- {0,1,2,3,4,5 ...}

# Integers
- 整数
- positive/negative integers and 0
- symbol: Z
- {... -3,-2,-1,0,1,2,3 ...}

# Fractions
- 分数, 小数
- represents portion of a whole thing (eg. 2/5)
- numerator and denominator are whole numbers, but denominator cannot be 0
- all fractions are rational numbers, but not all rational numbers are fractions
- notation 2/5
- types:
  - improper fractions
    - 仮分数
    - numerator (分子) is greater than denominator (分母)
    - eg. 7/5
  - proper fractions
    - 真分数
    - numerator (分子) is smaller than denominator (分母)
    - eg. 2/3

# Rational numbers
- 有理数
- represents two integers' ratio
- symbol: Q
- eg. 0.7 can be written in 7/10, meaning ratio of 7 against 10

# Irrational numbers
- 無理数
- is the ones that cannot be written as the ratio of two integers
- digits in irrational numbers continue for infinity without repeating pattern
- symbol: Q
- √2, √5, 0.353535…, π

# Decimals
- 10進数, 小数
- types:
  - Finite decimals
    - is a number which has last digits, digits do not continue for infinity
    - eg) 2/5 (0.4)
  - Infinite decimals
    - is a number which has infinite digits without pattern
    - eg) 2‾√ (1.4142 ...)
  - Repeating decimals
    - is a number which has repeating pattern in digits with regular pattern
    - eg) 1/3 (0.3333 ...)

# Real numbers
- 実数
- is a type of numbers including rational number and irrational number
  - integer
  - fractions
  - all decimal types
- symbol: R

# Imaginary numbers
- 虚数
- [TBD]

# Complex numbers
- 複素数
- [TBD]
