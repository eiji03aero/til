# Tips
## General
### Use script editor to develop apple script, not on fucking automator
- Somehow, writing apple script on automator app misses to provide you some advantages you can get from script editor app.
  - better logging, such as result, messages, events, replies
  - less complicated UI, easier to focus with.

## Debug
### Use `UI elements` to reveal the names of elements
- https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/87412
- When code execution encounters this statements, it prints out the UI elements in the current scope.
- Probably this is the only way to achieve element names, as accessibility inspector does not do much.

### Utilize `accessibility inspector` for something
- It is a tool comes with xcode.
- I played around a bit with it, but don't really know how this helps apple script development.
