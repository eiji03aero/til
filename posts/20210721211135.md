### 虎の巻

  - LSI
    - since LSI stores data as same as original table in physical way, index update is done synchronously as original table data is updated
    - thus it has strong data consitency
  - GSI
    - creates projection table. update to original table is reflected asynchronously
    - thus it has somewhat-weak data consistency
  - as a distributed KVS
    - since table is a collection of partitions, trying to architect it to distribute access equally among partitions would lead to better read performance

  - Key
    - dynamodb stores data into one or more partitions.
      - partition key determines which partition should data be stored to.
      - dynamodb uses partition key value to calculate hash value, which really determins which partition to be stored to
      - if index has sort key defined, data inside partition will always be sorted by that SK
    - types of keys
      - Partition key
        - determines how data are distributed among partitions
        - should try to make it in a way that partition access is equally done to partitions
      - Sort key
        - optional
        - used to sort data in partition sorted
        - with this key, you can filter out the result of Query
      - Primary key
        - this refers to either Partition key or compound key of Partition key and Sort key
        - this uniquely determins data in table
  - Secondary index
    - types of index
      - Global Secondary Index
        - creates projection table with PK
        - can be created up to 20 by default
        - can be used for better performance, but sounds like it consumes more disk space as you create more of it
        - can be created after table creation
      - Local Secondary Index
        - creates projection table with existing Partition key and different Sort key
        - can be created up to 5 by default
        - cannot be created after table creation

  - aws lambda overview
    - since 2019/9, aws lambda will work better with aws resource inside vpc
      - no more dynamically-created ENI
      - ENI will be created when lambda function is deployed
    - but has problem with bloated quantity of db connection from scaling lambda instances
      - when lambda horizontally scales, db connection could go up linearly
      - db instances could easily go run out of connection
    - dynamodb best practice
      - try to minimize the number of tables
  - db modeling comparison
    - RDB
      - business domain analysis, and build logical model, relationships
        - analyze business domain, and create logical models and relationship
        - normalize models with principle that one fact in one place
      - build physical modeling
        - based on logical model
        - physical key, data type, validation, DDL
      - implement application, sql
      - to deal with further development
        - extend models
    - dynamodb
      - business domain analysis, and build logical model, relationships
        - same as RDB
      - plan access pattern
        - based on analysis, list out access patterns
          - like create usecases. eg) query for employee data with employee_id
      - plan table and index
        - plan out table and index which satisfies usecases
      - plan query patterns
        - for each usecases, list out required stuff like:
          - which index to use
          - what parameter to accept
          - query condition
      - to deal with further development
        - update table, index
