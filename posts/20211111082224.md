---

- learn the history of how they have improved GC
  - current implementation
    - limitation?
    - what is it good at?
  - how has it been improved?
    - any notable immprovement?
  - any plan on improvement?

- learn standard lexer and parser package
  - try to come up with a tool to implement which utilize these packages
  - if learned these well, I will be more capable with working with golang
    - like supporting productivity in team development (refactoring tool? investigation tool?)

- learn pprof
  - https://tusharsheth.medium.com/how-i-found-memory-leaks-in-the-golang-app-using-pprof-56e5d55363ba

- learn how to utilize compiled code
  - how to inspect them
  - how to read them

- learn escape analysis
  - find documentation or presice article

- learn stack variable
  - what exactly is it?
  - why is it encouraged to take address of it?
    - go at goole article mentioned it in 12. Semantics section

- learn characteristics of the standard regexp package
  - how is it different from that of scripting language's
  - comparison on performance?
    - remember go's have stable performance as string gets longer

- learn CSP
  - what exactly is it?
  - how is it implemented in golang?

- [ ] learn golang internal assembler
  - https://golang.org/doc/asm

## Language specifics
- [ ] difference between slice declarations?
  - d := make([]int)
  - d := []int{}

- [ ] what does it take to initialize regexp object?
  - look into the package
  - try to comprehend overall flow of what it does
  - why do people say it is an expensive operation?

# Learning path
## Readings
- https://tour.golang.org/welcome/1
- https://golang.org/doc/effective_go
- [Go at Google: Language Design in the Service of Software Engineering](posts/20211114075410.md)

## Work
- at Qolony
  - developing server side application in golang
- at Crowdlog
  - supposedly I will be joining the development

## Project based
- Writing an interperter/compiler in Go
  - https://interpreterbook.com/
- Mess around with gokit package
  - https://github.com/eiji03aero/todos-los-dias
- mskit
  - https://github.com/eiji03aero/mskit
  - read an introductory book for microservices
    - https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/building-microservices/9781491950340/
  - this is the my own implementation of
    - set of tools to implement microservices in golang
    - the sample application provided in the book
- junretsu-counter
  - https://github.com/eiji03aero/junretsu-counter
  - it was for learning golang's concurrency features and explore the opmisability
  - totally threw it out in the middle for some reasons:
    - my private machine did not have many logical cpu cores
      - it was assumed that it will be hard to achieve the set performance goal
    - got bored on the way
- vcon
  - https://github.com/eiji03aero/vcon
  - this was an DIY project based on what one of my friend wanted to create
  - wanted to work on this as my hobby project for:
    - learn documenting and designing application in golang
  - thrown away in the middle, got bored on the way
- mash
  - https://github.com/eiji03aero/mash
  - this was to be yeah-this-is-my-masterpiece kind of portfolio project.
  - put so much efforts into it for both frontend and backend
  - adopted the strategical patterns learned in the microservices book, and mskit
  - faced a hardship with one of the serverside implementation:
    - implement filesystem service in event-sourcing pattern
  - kind of pending. want to come back to this when got time
- scraper
  - https://github.com/eiji03aero/scraper
  - work in progress
  - wanted to work on this for several reasons:
    - learn how to document and design golang app
    - learn golang itself
    - wanted to scrape audio data from nicovideo
  - this is supposed to be completed to full extent (because I really want the feature of it, wants to collect vocaloid songs!)

## Summaries
- [「Go言語らしさ」とは何か？　Simplicityの哲学を理解し、Go Wayに沿った開発を進めることの良さ](https://eh-career.com/engineerhub/entry/2018/06/19/110000)
  - go is a programming language that aims to solve problems in software development at scale
    - it is not a language to R&D programming language itself.
    - it is created and designed to solve the problems:
      - scaling development team
  - go is a language with three different periodical perspectives on mind
    - past:
      - its design is developed based on creators' and maintainers' past experience (c language, unix, utf-8)
    - current: 
      - trying to provide the features that solve problems present
    - future:
      - trying to develop the language with what will be desired in future in mind
  - goals of go
    - scalable as software development
      - pursuing simplicity
      - provide tools which is convention over configuration, consistency even across different workplace
      - combines two different kinds
        - feel of writing codes like interpreted language
          - compiles fast
          - type inference
          - garbage collection
        - benefits of compiled language
          - program is protected by being statically typed
          - emits executable which runs fast
    - scalable as software proogram
      - features to make most of multi-core machines
      - emits code which executes fast
  - to become gopher
    - follow conventions (linter, formatter, other official tools)
    - read effective go
  - powerful features of go
    - abstraction with interface
    - builtin concurrent programming
- [今goのエラーハンドリングを無難にしておく方法（2021.09現在）](https://zenn.dev/nekoshita/articles/097e00c6d3d1c9)
  - go2 is expected to add more features to error handling
  - until then, what this article suggests is:
    - for cases which do not require stacktrace, utilize standard errors package
      - errors.Errorf to wrap error
      - errors.Is to handle errors based on type
    - for cases which do require stacktrace, utilize pkg/errors package
      - errors.WithStack to add stacktrace where you want to retrieve
      - errors.Wrap to add stacktrace on anywhere you want to trace stack
  - about pkg/errors
    - this is not actively developed any more, as its purpose was fulfilled by go2 to introduce those additional features
  - about xerrors
    - this is deprecated. do not use it
