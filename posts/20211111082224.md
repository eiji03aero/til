## Work
- at Qolony
  - developing server side application in golang
- at Crowdlog
  - supposedly I will be joining the development

## Project based
### [todos-los-dias](https://github.com/eiji03aero/todos-los-dias)
- just wanted to try out some framework

### [junretsu-counter](https://github.com/eiji03aero/junretsu-counter)
- it was for learning golang's concurrency features and explore the optimizability
- totally abandoned this in the middle for some reasons:
  - my private machine did not have many logical cpu cores
    - it was assumed that it will be hard to achieve the set performance goal without adequate number of cpu cores
  - got bored on the way

### [vcon](https://github.com/eiji03aero/vcon)
- this was an DIY project based on what one of my friend wanted to create
- wanted to work on this as my hobby project for:
  - learn documenting and designing application in golang
- thrown away in the middle, got bored on the way

### [mskit](https://github.com/eiji03aero/mskit)
- read an introductory book for microservices
  - https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/building-microservices/9781491950340/
- this is my own implementation of:
  - set of tools to implement microservices in golang
  - the sample application provided in the book

### [mash](https://github.com/eiji03aero/mash)
- this was supposed to be yeah-this-is-my-masterpiece kind of portfolio project.
- put so much efforts into both frontend and backend
  - could it be awesomer?
- adopted strategical patterns learned in the microservices book while developing mskit module
- faced a hardship with one of the serverside implementation:
  - implement filesystem service in event-sourcing pattern
- kind of pending. want to come back to this when got time

### [scraper](https://github.com/eiji03aero/scraper)
- work in progress
- wanted to work on this for several reasons:
  - learn how to document and design golang app
  - learn golang itself
  - wanted to scrape audio data from nicovideo
- this is supposed to be completed to full extent (because I really want the feature of it, wants to collect vocaloid songs!)
