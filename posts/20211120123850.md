# Shell
## zsh
### builtin command not found (ps, awk, tr ...)
- Problem
  - When ran a custom shell function, from certain points onward, executing builtin command threw error.
- Cause
  - It was because part of the function sets a value to `path` variable.
    - which I knew shell's variable scope is kind of weird and loose.
  - This is a special variable managed by zsh
    - setting value to it modifies `PATH` variable as well. wtf ... ?
- Solution
  - Changed variable identifier from `path` to `file_path`
