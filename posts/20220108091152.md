## Hooks
- [React.useEffectの分かりにくさをなんとかしたい](https://zenn.dev/u_motion/articles/4dd45c204d2db1)
    - about the tips for effective usage of useEffect
    - #1. Give name to effect
        - as number of useEffect grows, it will get harder to comprehend which effect works for what purpose.
        - to mitigate this chaos, we can give name to the callback function
    - #2. Utilize 3rd party lib which is designed for easier use.
        - like react-use
        - they provide more declarative apis with simpler use
- [Underrated React Hooks you’re missing out on](https://blog.logrocket.com/underrated-react-hooks-youre-missing-out-on/)
    - useImperativeHandle
        - this allows parent component to access properties of child component
        - eg)
            - child component exposes its own handlers/functions to useImperativeHandle
            - parent component pass ref to child component prop
            - parent component can access what are exposed through useImperativeHandle
    - useLayoutEffect
        - this allows react logic to be run before React render is reflected to browser paints
        - difference b/w useEffect and useLayoutEffect would be:
            - useEffect: DOM updates => Browser paints the update for users to see => useEffect is run => another DOM update => Broswer paints the second update for user to see
            - useLayoutEffect: DOM updates => useLayoutEffect is run =>another DOM update => Broswer paints the overall update for user to see
- [How to Cleanup Side Effects in React](https://medium.com/@dev_one/how-to-cleanup-side-effects-in-react-1db4ac14857b)
    - an article urging to clean up the mess when useEffect unmounts
- [How to use useCallback() hook](https://medium.com/@dev_one/how-to-use-usecallback-hook-35dc047aee48)
    - overuse of memoization could rather harm performance

## Memoization
- [Reactのメモ化と、メモ化できないケースについて](https://zenn.dev/ykdr8/articles/e08ac2b0e7b880)
    - About the cases where you cannot/shouldn't rely on memoization
    - #1. When you want the value to be semantically kept, not being purged
        - React compiler might make some updates about how it handles memoized values,
            - eg) purging value for better memory footprint
        - Devs are encouraged to use these memoization apis only for optimizing rendering perfs.
            - should not overuse these apis. they are meant for optmizing perfs. perfs!!!!
    - #2. Memoize array and the elements of it
        - useMemo cannot be used inside control structure.
        - to memotize the elements (objects) of array, you need little trick
            - normarizing array is one of the options
        - do we really need this complicated method for perf?
            - can't we just work-around it by manipulating array in a direct manner?

## StrictMode

## StrictEffectMode

## JSX
- [Introducing the New JSX Transform](https://reactjs.org/blog/2020/09/22/introducing-the-new-jsx-transform.html)
    - this eliminates the need of manually import React object to a file which defines a React component
    - this is possible because they made some specifications like:
        - certain entry point with certain named export to provide what used to be configured by devs


# Architectural patterns
- [React, Vue, and Business Logic](https://javascript.plainenglish.io/react-vue-and-business-logic-19df105698a2)
    - UI is not crucial to product, but data and logic are.
    - where to write business logic?
    - in container component?
        - no, for two reasons:
            - now business is coupled with UI
            - now business logic is married with framework
                - is part of React realm
    - logic should be extracted to somewhere UI agnostic
        - like redux reducer
- [React Router Architecture That’s Simple, Scalable, and Protected](https://betterprogramming.pub/react-router-architecture-thats-simple-scalable-and-protected-da896827f946)

    - ReadyFor's thoughts on designing react application architecture
    - Should we use redux?
        - one criteria would be:
            - yes ... if frontend has complicated presentational logic
            - no ... else
    - redux has advantages like
        - handle complicated logic and state management
        - better usability for integration test
            - with cypress, you can test with just firing actions to see if expected UI is shown
        - minimizing the range of incluence (selector, connect's memoization)
    - Structuring redux store
        - To separate concerns better, group them into four categories. each can depend on the modules above than itself (like subscribing for actions)
            - api
            - app
            - ui
            - page

        - Not really sure about this. the core models should not depend on external system models
    - Concisely designed page implementation
        - Query
        - Resource state
        - Form state
        - Views

    - should write an article dedicated for summarizing this repo and its doc


# State management patterns
- [React state management in 2022 — Return of the Redux](https://engineering.udacity.com/react-state-management-in-2022-return-of-the-redux-87218f56486b)
    - three states to handle:
        - local state
        - global state
        - server state
    - For server state, author used to think swr, ReactQuery were the choice, thus redux was not really a choice for state management
    - However, ReduxToolkit released its own implementation of this server state management mechanism, ReduxToolkitQuery
    - Author is thinking redux might still be relavant
- [The modern guide to React state patterns](https://blog.logrocket.com/modern-guide-react-state-patterns/)
    - as application grows, state management becomes harder
        - prop drilling through multiple layers of components
        - have to juggle ownership of state by lifting it up among ancestors
        - unnecessary re-renders
    - redux is the prominent and most popular tool to solve state management hardships
    - react hooks api provides basic functionality around state management
    - state machine tool like XState helps by providing stricter state-machines which gives better predictability
- [[React]useStateによるstate管理の問題点とその解決方法を模索した結果、3つの機能を分離するに至った話](https://qiita.com/SoraKumo/items/6267133940c15c89481e)
    - States problems with useState
    - useState combines three responsibilitires:
        - create and hold state
        - updates state
        - provides current state
    - these lead to problems such as:
        - component holds state always have to re-render when state change
        - the higher component is in tree, the more chances to causes unnecessary re-renders in itself and descendent components
