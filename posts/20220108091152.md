# Versions

## V18
- [React JS 18: An overview of its new features and updates](https://medium.com/dhiwise/react-18-new-features-and-updates-2e608d862a6d)
    - new root api
        - improves how it handles the connection b/w DOM and react realm
        - improves hydration
    -  improved automatic batching
        - enabled by root api
        - updates used to be batched only when updates were triggered within react event handler
        - with this improvement, batching will be done at any timing automatically (batched periodically?)
    - transition api
        - useTransition to specify certain updates as low priority
        - other api to hook into if transition is going on
    - improved suspense usage in SSR
        - streaming html
        - selective hydration


# Internals
- [Understanding React's key prop](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/understanding-reacts-key-prop)
    - about special key prop
    - if key prop on ReactElement is changed, Element will be recreated
    - this could be useful for some cases:
        - recreating form element (input) to set to defaultvalue
- [Event Pooling](https://reactjs.org/docs/legacy-event-pooling.html)
    - This is for React v16 and earlier and React Native
    - is not relevant for Reactv17 and onwards
        - https://reactjs.org/blog/2020/08/10/react-v17-rc.html#no-event-pooling


# Features

## Suspense

## Hooks
- [React.useEffectの分かりにくさをなんとかしたい](https://zenn.dev/u_motion/articles/4dd45c204d2db1)
    - about the tips for effective usage of useEffect
    - #1. Give name to effect
        - as number of useEffect grows, it will get harder to comprehend which effect works for what purpose.
        - to mitigate this chaos, we can give name to the callback function
    - #2. Utilize 3rd party lib which is designed for easier use.
        - like react-use
        - they provide more declarative apis with simpler use
- [Underrated React Hooks you’re missing out on](https://blog.logrocket.com/underrated-react-hooks-youre-missing-out-on/)
    - useImperativeHandle
        - this allows parent component to access properties of child component
        - eg)
            - child component exposes its own handlers/functions to useImperativeHandle
            - parent component pass ref to child component prop
            - parent component can access what are exposed through useImperativeHandle
    - useLayoutEffect
        - this allows react logic to be run before React render is reflected to browser paints
        - difference b/w useEffect and useLayoutEffect would be:
            - useEffect: DOM updates => Browser paints the update for users to see => useEffect is run => another DOM update => Broswer paints the second update for user to see
            - useLayoutEffect: DOM updates => useLayoutEffect is run =>another DOM update => Broswer paints the overall update for user to see
- [How to Cleanup Side Effects in React](https://medium.com/@dev_one/how-to-cleanup-side-effects-in-react-1db4ac14857b)
    - an article urging to clean up the mess when useEffect unmounts
- [How to use useCallback() hook](https://medium.com/@dev_one/how-to-use-usecallback-hook-35dc047aee48)
    - overuse of memoization could rather harm performance

## Memoization
- [そこのお前！　余計なuseMemo1個に含まれるオーバーヘッドは余計なdiv 0.57個分だぜ！](https://qiita.com/uhyo/items/59124425ca1dee3da891)
    - according to the benchmark from this article, execution performance is really not infcluenced by overuse of useMemo
    - thus the author claims that we should be encouraged to use useMemo whenever the fuck we can
    - this is insane
- [useCallbackはとにかく使え！　特にカスタムフックでは](https://blog.uhy.ooo/entry/2021-02-23/usecallback-custom-hooks/)
    - the functions returned from custom hook should always be useCallback-ed
        - yeah for sure ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
- [Reactのメモ化と、メモ化できないケースについて](https://zenn.dev/ykdr8/articles/e08ac2b0e7b880)
    - About the cases where you cannot/shouldn't rely on memoization
    - #1. When you want the value to be semantically kept, not being purged
        - React compiler might make some updates about how it handles memoized values,
            - eg) purging value for better memory footprint
        - Devs are encouraged to use these memoization apis only for optimizing rendering perfs.
            - should not overuse these apis. they are meant for optmizing perfs. perfs!!!!
    - #2. Memoize array and the elements of it
        - useMemo cannot be used inside control structure.
        - to memotize the elements (objects) of array, you need little trick
            - normarizing array is one of the options
        - do we really need this complicated method for perf?
            - can't we just work-around it by manipulating array in a direct manner?

## StrictMode

## StrictEffectMode

## JSX
- [Introducing the New JSX Transform](https://reactjs.org/blog/2020/09/22/introducing-the-new-jsx-transform.html)
    - this eliminates the need of manually import React object to a file which defines a React component
    - this is possible because they made some specifications like:
        - certain entry point with certain named export to provide what used to be configured by devs


# Architectural patterns
- [2020年に立ち上げたWebフロントエンド構成の振り返り](https://zenn.dev/yoshiko/articles/32371c83e68cbe)
    - application arch
        - Component
        - Usecase: receives dependencies as arguments for testability and simplicity
        - Repository: is just an implementation of repository pattern against server apis
        - Store (recoil?)
    - component directories
        - components/page ... represents page
        - components/model ... components concerned with certain model (eg. model/user/UserAvatar)
        - components/ui ... components not concerned with certain model (eg. checkbox, button)
        - components/functional ... components basically not have ui but logic purpose (eg. ErrorBoundary, If/Else?)
    - utilizing scaffolding lib
        - use scaffdog for creating new file (model, page ...)
- [Webフロントエンドの開発効率を高く保つための考え方](https://zenn.dev/adwd/articles/e173f75c512e10)
    - couple of ideas to keep frontend development productive
    - 'worse is better' idea
        - implementing perfectly and logically architected application is just not feasible
            - eg) not to isolate frontend's business logic from api-objects so that there will be less code, in return purity of business logic would be lost
    - learnings from clean architecture book
        - bad-code is always slower than good-code
            - writing badly-written code is always slower than well-thought-out-written code
        - structure of program is as important as the value it delivers (software value)
            - better: lots of bugs but easy to make change
            - worse: perfectly implemented but harder to make change
    - know 'official doc + little more' when introducing library
        - if neglect above, which should not take that long, the written codes might already be a debt that needs rewrite, as it would have a wrong usage/implementation
    - get along with how it is expected to be used by Language, framework, library
        - you should not forcefully introduce something else (eg. paradigm, FP) into what you have
        - what you have should expect certain usecase. what is not expected by them will inevitably bring compellings and debt to pay later
- [React, Vue, and Business Logic](https://javascript.plainenglish.io/react-vue-and-business-logic-19df105698a2)
    - UI is not crucial to product, but data and logic are.
    - where to write business logic?
    - in container component?
        - no, for two reasons:
            - now business is coupled with UI
            - now business logic is married with framework
                - is part of React realm
    - logic should be extracted to somewhere UI agnostic
        - like redux reducer

- [Next.js導入で責務の所在を明確化 READYFORのフロントエンド分離戦略](https://logmi.jp/tech/articles/324137)
    - ReadyFor's thoughts on designing react application architecture
    - Should we use redux?
        - one criteria would be:
            - yes ... if frontend has complicated presentational logic
            - no ... else
    - redux has advantages like
        - handle complicated logic and state management
        - better usability for integration test
            - with cypress, you can test with just firing actions to see if expected UI is shown
        - minimizing the range of incluence (selector, connect's memoization)
    - Structuring redux store
        - To separate concerns better, group them into four categories. each can depend on the modules above than itself (like subscribing for actions)
            - api
            - app
            - ui
            - page

- [SPAでのデータの流れ方を設計するための一つの考え方](https://qiita.com/mosmos21/items/7ab6b9b62941bf7f681e)
    - Basically rely on openapi schema to generate typescript types. use them for even base of models used in core logics
        - Not really sure about this. the core models should not depend on external system models
    - Concisely designed page implementation
        - Query
        - Resource state
        - Form state
        - Views
        - Template
            - Pass query-params to underlying state and logic and components
- [Integrating imperative APIs into a React application](https://netflixtechblog.com/integrating-imperative-apis-into-a-react-application-1257e1b45ac6)
    - They had a reuiqrement for playing video on top page of netflix TV platform:
        - playing video based on user's interaction
        - to play video, frontend has to call backend api for fetching video data
    - They achieved above by encapsulating logics inside one react component which can be leveraged via props
        - further state chagnes are handled inside this component. client code (parent compoennt) does not have to know these deatils.
     - Encountered problem with dynamic attributes
        - example was about time prop to specify the playback location of video
        - they tackled this problem by separating the responsibility of this prop into setter and getter:
            - time ... setting the desired playback location by client code
            - reportedTime ... for client code to get the actual playback location


# State management patterns
- [React State Management](https://betterprogramming.pub/react-state-management-7e7f3a2018e4)
    - what exactly state?
        - it is a fact that determines the conditions of an application at a given point of time
        - UI is the representation of state
    - kinds of state
        - server state
        - navigational state
        - local ui state
        - global state
- [The State Initializer Pattern](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/the-state-initializer-pattern)
    - Utilize key prop to recreate certain component to reduce hassle of managing state
- [Application State Management with React](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/application-state-management-with-react)
    - Redux used to be the go-to state management solution, but it was not really done right
        - devs put all kind of states into the global state
        - react-redux struggles with how it connects store and component without bringing performance issues
    - Author believes React itself should be responsible for state management
        - state should belong to locations (components in react tree) which is semantically related
        - stick with lifting state up method
            - this could lead to reborn of prop-drilling problem
            - it could be mitigated by component composition pattern
                - but it cannot be used all the way through the application ... 
            - ultimately, we should make use of context api
- [React state management in 2022 — Return of the Redux](https://engineering.udacity.com/react-state-management-in-2022-return-of-the-redux-87218f56486b)
    - three states to handle:
        - local state
        - global state
        - server state
    - For server state, author used to think swr, ReactQuery were the choice, thus redux was not really a choice for state management
    - However, ReduxToolkit released its own implementation of this server state management mechanism, ReduxToolkitQuery
    - Author is thinking redux might still be relavant
- [The modern guide to React state patterns](https://blog.logrocket.com/modern-guide-react-state-patterns/)
    - as application grows, state management becomes harder
        - prop drilling through multiple layers of components
        - have to juggle ownership of state by lifting it up among ancestors
        - unnecessary re-renders
    - redux is the prominent and most popular tool to solve state management hardships
    - react hooks api provides basic functionality around state management
    - state machine tool like XState helps by providing stricter state-machines which gives better predictability
- [[React]useStateによるstate管理の問題点とその解決方法を模索した結果、3つの機能を分離するに至った話](https://qiita.com/SoraKumo/items/6267133940c15c89481e)
    - States problems with useState
    - useState combines three responsibilitires:
        - create and hold state
        - updates state
        - provides current state
    - these lead to problems such as:
        - component holds state always have to re-render when state change
        - the higher component is in tree, the more chances to causes unnecessary re-renders in itself and descendent components
- [Redux vs. Context vs. State](https://betterprogramming.pub/redux-vs-context-vs-state-4202be6d3e54)
    - state management patterns note
    - comparison between state, context, redux

## Libraries

### Recoil
- https://recoiljs.org/

### Akita
- https://datorama.github.io/akita/
- integrates OOP paradigm pretty nicely
    - implementing logics in OOP class way
- consists of some main components:
    - Store
        - Holds state
    - Query
        - a way to retrieve Store values?
        - read the state and calculate certain value?

### Hookstate
- https://hookstate.js.org/
- Can handle (get/set) state even outside of React
- Kind of too opinionated
    - Nested state
        - proxied properties
        - object-specific apis with magic (merge, get/set on property)
- cons:
    - codebase is bound to be in a Hookstate-way


# Data fetching mechanism

## Libraries
- https://react-query.tanstack.com/comparison
    - comparison by React Query
    - seems to be React Query totally aces this comparison
    - swr might be the sole competitor in this race as apollo is meant for grpahql-use and rtk-query is for redux
    - swr seems to win for bundle size by 3 times
    - but react query has way more features, seems to be more promising into long-term development
- seems to be swr leans toward easy-to-use spot
- on the other hand react-query goes for more robust and versatile direction

## React Query
- [React Query Learning note](posts/20220118071702.md)
- https://react-query.tanstack.com/
- Really detailed doc, awesome work done!
- Yes there is API reference page, this is what I'm talking about!


## SWR
- https://swr.vercel.app/
- not really detailed doc
    - no api reference page?
- does it have only useSWR and SWRConfig component exported?
- seems to be this lib is focused on fetching and caching server state data
    - as the top page describes what SWR stand for
    - mutation (POST,UPDATE,DELETE) seems not be 1st class citizen in this lib

## RTK Query
- https://redux-toolkit.js.org/rtk-query/overview
- is only meant to be used with redux

## [React Hook Form](https://react-hook-form.com/)
- [Implement a Layered Architecture by React Hook Form (v7)](https://dev.to/texmeijin/component-design-idea-using-react-hook-form-v7-ie0)
    - Three layers to implement layered architecture
    - view layer
        - renders concrete UI component
        - accepts necessary props
    - logic layer
        - introduces RHF form control feature (useController)
        - renders view layer
    - form layer
        - introduces RHF form feature (useForm)
        - provides control object to logic layer
    - points
        - benefit from separating layers
            - the view layer components can be used outside of form
                - since it is not dependant on a certain form library
