# How Netflix Scales its API with GraphQL Federation (Part 2)
https://netflixtechblog.com/how-netflix-scales-its-api-with-graphql-federation-part-2-bbe71aaec44a

# Summary
- after laid foundation for graphql federation, netflix started migrating process from monolithic graphql service to
  federated one consists of the components described in the previous article.
- biggest challenge against it was aligning this infrastructure across organization. had skepticism.
- after settlement, they started working on core infrastructure.
  - graphql gateway was implemented based on apollo's reference implementation
  - schema registry was developed as internal library.
    - it uses event-sourcing pattern, which enables holding registry history feature
    - uses cassandra
- with this new architecture, instead of only graphql team, all the team has to build expertise in graphql, since they expose subsection of entire graph respectively
  - learning curve for graphql had some challenges:
    - batching
    - lookahead
  - to help them, they built:
    - documentation
    - training materials
    - tutorials
    - internal community for discussion, Q&As
    - domain graph service library
- it was anticipated that active management of graph schema was essential to overall health
  - ideal goal for managing graph schema was to making it to be reflection of domain itself, rather than database model
    - ui developers should not had BFF for molding data, instead they should corporate with BE to shape the schema to be consistent with conceptual domain models
      - from DDD perspective, this is essential. this should strenthen resilience of softwares against frequent updates in business
- observability was also prioritized
  - because in the privious architecture, this was achieved in pretty much manual way, which does not scale
  - three key areas were:
    - alerting: when something happend, team should be notified
    - discovery: what is not working
    - diagnosis: help debugging why it is not working
  - they added integration on graphql types to implementor teams slack channel to reduce the time to debug
- federated graph had to support security stuff
  - authentication
    - graphql gateway is restricted to only the authenticated users
  - authorization
    - in previous architecture, implementation of authorization was spread across teams with different methods
    - in new architecture, dgs owners have responsibility for the types they own
- graphql gateway has to be resilient, sicne this is a single point of failure inevitably
  - to strengthen it:
    - single purposed
      - by focusing what it does, we can reduce the range of problems that potentially occur
    - stateless service
    - demand controlled
    - multi region
    - sharded by functionality
      - they separate instances for subscriptions and query/mutations
        - so that subscription specific problems does not affect query/mutations operations
