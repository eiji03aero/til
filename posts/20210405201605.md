# Summary
- Steams api in Node.js is a module that help to deal with large chunk of data.
- Instead of loading all the bytes of data, it splits the data into smaller chunks and pushes them to application code.
- Has 4 different types, but Readable and Writable are the basic ones.

## What is a stream?
- stream api in Node.js creates a flow of sequential data which would be pushed to application code.
- what you can gain from this would be:
  - efficient memory usage
  - higher throughput
  - process large chunk of data with less powerful device.
- usually, these are utilized in built-in modules internally. but you can use directly use them for flexibility

## Stream composability
- like unix command pipelines, streams can be piped to add functionality

## Types of streams
- Readble
  - emits flow of data
- Writable
  - accepts chunks from Readable and allow to do some process with it by calling pipe method.
- Duplex
  - it can be read and written
- Transform
  - it can transform data and following writable will receive them.

# Thoughts
- Still how readline library reads filestream remains unclear.
