### V4.5
- [What’s New in TypeScript 4.5?](https://betterprogramming.pub/whats-new-in-typescript-4-5-57d6b88b1e72)
    - Awaited type (no need to infer to extract type from Promise value)

## React
### Features
- [Introducing the New JSX Transform](https://reactjs.org/blog/2020/09/22/introducing-the-new-jsx-transform.html)
    - this eliminates the need of manually import React object to a file which defines a React component
    - this is possible because they made some specifications like:
        - certain entry point with certain named export to provide what used to be configured by devs

### Tips
#### Hooks
- [React.useEffectの分かりにくさをなんとかしたい](https://zenn.dev/u_motion/articles/4dd45c204d2db1)
    - about the tips for effective usage of useEffect
    - tips
        - #1. Give name to effect
            - as number of useEffect grows, it will get harder to comprehend which effect works for what purpose.
            - to mitigate this chaos, we can give name to the callback function
        - #2. Utilize 3rd party lib which is designed for easier use.
            - like react-use
            - they provide more declarative apis with simpler use
- [Underrated React Hooks you’re missing out on](https://blog.logrocket.com/underrated-react-hooks-youre-missing-out-on/)
    - useImperativeHandle
        - this allows parent component to access properties of child component
        - eg)
            - child component exposes its own handlers/functions to useImperativeHandle
            - parent component pass ref to child component prop
            - parent component can access what are exposed through useImperativeHandle
    - useLayoutEffect
        - this allows react logic to be run before React render is reflected to browser paints
        - difference b/w useEffect and useLayoutEffect would be:
            - useEffect: DOM updates => Browser paints the update for users to see => useEffect is run => another DOM update => Broswer paints the second update for user to see
            - useLayoutEffect: DOM updates => useLayoutEffect is run =>another DOM update => Broswer paints the overall update for user to see
- [How to Cleanup Side Effects in React](https://medium.com/@dev_one/how-to-cleanup-side-effects-in-react-1db4ac14857b)
    - an article urging to clean up the mess when useEffect unmounts
- [How to use useCallback() hook](https://medium.com/@dev_one/how-to-use-usecallback-hook-35dc047aee48)
    - overuse of memoization could rather harm performance

#### Memoization
- [Reactのメモ化と、メモ化できないケースについて](https://zenn.dev/ykdr8/articles/e08ac2b0e7b880)
    - The cases that you cannot/shouldn't rely on memoization
        - #1. When you want the value to be semantically kept, not being purged
            - React compiler might make some updates about how it handles memoized values,
                - eg) purging value for better memory footprint
            - Devs are encouraged to use these memoization apis only for optimizing rendering perfs.
                - should not overuse these apis. they are meant for optmizing perfs. perfs!!!!
        - #2. Memoize array and the elements of it
            - useMemo cannot be used inside control structure.
            - to memotize the elements (objects) of array, you need little trick
                - normarizing array is one of the options
            - do we really need this complicated method for perf?
                - can't we just work-around it by manipulating array in a direct manner?

## Storybook
- [Interactive stories (beta)](https://storybook.js.org/blog/interactive-stories-beta/)
    - kind of an implementation of automated testing by storybook which includes user's interctions.
    - can test per component (presen, container, view, page. plus you can insert mock as well)
