# Frontend reading-list
Collection of links to the articles that I wanted to read.

If found interesting, I should create summary article and attach link to this article.

Otherwise, just erase the link.

## Todo
- [ ] Create article dedicated for React
    - Create learning-note. Just like Golang did
    - Move all the React related content from here to that new article
    - Move content from React scribble as well, and then delete scribble article
