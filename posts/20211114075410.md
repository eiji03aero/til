# Go at Google: Language Design in the Service of Software Engineering
https://talks.golang.org/2012/splash.article

---

# Summary
- go is a programming language designed to deal with realworld software development in mind.
- the goals of it are:
  - making the development process/team scalable
  - allowing developers to write scaleble code easily

---

# Content
## Go at google
- Software development at google was like:
  - developing millions of lines of softwares by thousands of engineers
  - mostly in c++, plus java and python as well
- Developing these large scale softwares were pain in the ass:
  - too long to build
  - complicated to make updates to
- Thus developmenet was slow and clumsy.
- Golang was created to solve these realworld problem with software development at bigger scale.

## Pain points
- Issues with large-scale software development:
  - slow builds
  - uncontrolled dependencies
  - diversed use of different programming language
  - code with poor quality for maintenance on mind (hard to read, no documents)
  - duplication of effort
  - cost of updates
  - difficulty of writing automatic tools (like gofmt and gofix?)
  - cross-language builds
- These issues cannot be solved by efforts from individual programming language, instead, we have to rethink from the point of software engineering.

## Dependencies in C and C++
- They utilize macro to include dependencies in source code.
  - ufilize ifndef macro to guard from including duplicate codes in compied code.
- Pain of this approach is:
  - it could deteriorate building performance
    - it could lead to opening/reading/scanning same header file multiple times which are not necessary.
  - hard to know which one is not required any more
    - hard to test if removing one is safe
- Alternative approach by Plan 9
  - Allowing only one header file to exist in codebase
  - This way, we could avoid the problems mentioned above.
  - Led to significantly better compilation time.
- Alternative approach by divide-and-conquer Makefile approach
  - Have Makefile per directory.
  - Can manage dependencies in better granularity, optimize compilation performance.
- Alternative approach to optimize compilation by multi-machine build
  - distribute compilation work to multiple machines, let them work concurrently
  - even with this approach, in 2007, it takes around 45 min. to build one of their large build

## Enter Go
- When it takes 45 min. to build your application, you have some time to think. (this line is my favorite, funny good one!)
- One of the myths says that go was conceived during that 45 min. build time.
- Other stuff to consider when designing go was:
  - Large scale in mind. large program, large number of dependencies, large teams of programmers to work in it.
  - Must be familiar. Most of the programmers at google was familar with C-family language, thus the new language should feel familiar to them.
  - Must be modern. Meaning, It should have following on mind:
    - multi-core machines (to pull out full potential of the machines they are executed on)
    - networking (don't really know what was meant by this. didn't C,C++,java take care of these?)
    - web application development


# Dependencies in Go
- Go's dependencies are handled by language specification
  - is engraved into language core
    - defined syntactically and semantically
  - is explicit, clear and easy to parse/utilize by others
- fails compilation if compiler finds unused dependency
  - is good for long term maintenance. build is promised to be optimzed all the time
- building proceeds from bottom to top
  - builds from the least dependent ones, making way up to the outer-most file (entrypoint)
- when file is compiled, generated object file would:
  - include type information for all the dependencies of that file that affect the public interface of the file
  - place the export data at the top of object file for compilation performance
    - compiler to read only to the certain part of file from the top
- compiler forbids circular dependency
  - problems with circular dependency
    - puts burden on compilation work
      - have to deal with larger portion of codes to properly resolve dependencies
    - complicating things such as:
      - initialization
      - testing
      - refactoring
      - releasing
  - goods of forbidding circular deps would be:
    - forcing developers to design program in cleaner way
      - have to properly design dependency
- in standard packages, some tricks are used to optimize building go app in general
  - sort of duplicating logic in respective packages so that they won't have to include other bigger packages

## Packages
- package path have to be unique
- package name does not have to be unique through out codebase

## Syntax
- go puts importance on syntax:
  - syntax is the user interface of programming language. this is what software developer deals with
  - thought it does not have much effect on the semantics of the language, it determines the readability hence clarify of language
    - this is directly associated with one of the goals of go as a project
  - plus go puts importance of simplicity of syntax, since it has effects of easeness of implementing tooling
- remarks of go syntax
  - only 25 keywords (C++11 has 84)
  - go can be parsed without type information or a symbol table
    - don't really know what this part means
  - different type declaration from C
    - identifier appears before type name
    - this is easier for both human and computer to parse/comprehend
  - function can return multiple values
  - does not support default function arguments
    - it is by design for reasons like:
      - it tends to be overdosed, which results in hard to disassemble function or understand the function
    - lack of default arguments leads to more explicitness, clearer boundary over API, easier to understand
  - for some cases, this can be handled by variadic arguments

## Naming
- naming is used to determin visibility of certain portion of code (variable, function, type ...)
  - by putting the visibility information in name, go can make the source code more conceivable and readable
    - no need to jump to declaration to check visibility
- no implicit this. always have to denote the receiver
  - that part of java is really confusing
- how importing dependencies works with name-scope helps clarity as well
  - the external package usually can be accessed via package name
  - thus name scope is always properly separated
    - no concern to break client code's name space

## Semantics
- it is designed to let developers feel familiar who has experience in C-family language
  - helps them learn quickly
- changes made to C-semantics would be:
  - no pointer arithmetic
  - no implicit numeric conversions
  - array bounds to always be checked
  - no type alias (type X int and int are two different types, the interpretation can be widen though)
  - ++ and -- are statements
  - assignment is not an expression
  - legal to take the address of stack variable
    - even encouraged
    - don't really know what stack variables are (put in todo for researching this)

## Concurrency
- this is important quality to pursue in the modern age, where multi-core machines are wide spread
- go embodies CSP with first-class primitive 'channels'
  - CSP was chosen because:
    - one of the creator was familiar with it
    - it was a good fit for procedural programming model without introducing radical change to it
    - allowing building a program which basically procedural and partially concurrent
- one caveat would be that go is not purely memory safe because it has concurrency
- go provides simple and safe concurrent programming, but it does not protect you from bad programming with concurrency
  - their stance is advocating a slogan:
    - don't communicate by sharing memory, instead share memory by communicating
      - supposedly through channel

## Garbage collection
- it was an easy decision to introduce garbage collection to go
  - in concurrent object-oriented language, having GC was a must, becuase objects are passed around, thus it would be hard to track them and free when required
- go does not provie feature to explicitly free certain memory address
  - it always has to be done via garbage collector
- cost of GC
  - general overhead
  - latency
  - complexity of the implementation
- however, the creators believe that benefits of having GC is bigger than the costs mentioned above
- go provides space for optimization around memory management
  - defining a struct with certain rule
    - the top-bigger to bottom-smaller best practice?
      - this kind of interrupts how developer wants to write code though, like grouping fields, ordering fields in certain order.
- go can easily provide second-order allocators
  - DKWTM
- go officially provides tools to measure memory performance
- to provide flexibility over GC and memory, go support what they call interior pointer
  - interior pointer refers to a pointer lives within a struct. programmer can pass this underlying field to other code (this should allow optimizing performance)
    - states that java cannot do this
  - this affects the selection of collection algorithm to use
  - DKWTM
- GC is a field that they actively work on (in 2012, probably most of the work has already been done yet?)


## Composition not inheritance
- allows defining method on any kind of types
- no support for subclassing, creating hierarchy of classes
  - they believe type hierarchy leads to brittle code
  - to properly make use of it, developers have to put so much effort in designing phase
    - properly design the components with the future change in mind
    - early decisions will be hard to change once program is implemented
- utilizing interface to segregate components should lead to better software in long term
  - simpler relationship among components
  - change of interface only affects the client code which directly utilize them
    - with type-hierarchy, it won't be this simple (no idea)
- loose coupling leads to scalability as codebase

## Errors
- go does not have exception system by design
- convention is that if execution of certain portion of code had an error, return that error to the client, not throwing it
  - this way, error-handling is always done explicitly
- forcing programmers to deal with errors one by one promotes them to:
  - think about proper error handling
  - not ignore possible error handling

## Tools
- for one of the goal of go, which scalability of devvelopment, they develop language with tooling in mind
  - provides building components for toolings (lexer, parser, type checker)
- gofmt
  - is a defacto formatter among community, provided officially
    - thus gopghers kind of all agree with the coding style on certain areas.
  - eliminates the hassle of arguments over how code is lexically written
    - for god's sake!
- gofix
  - DKWTM
- gofmt and gofix helps the language development moving forward as it helps to ease the migration over breaking change

# Thoughts
- Didn't really get what was meant by 'networking' as one of the factors that modern software development should take care
  - article states C,C++,java do not take care of this part well
  - how execaly are these not really suitable for handling networking?
- What does it mean to require type information or symbol table to parse programming language?
  - probably it can be looked up by researching java
- what really is second-order allocators?
  - article states, as an example of it, it has something to do with effectively managing array of object
- what really is interior pointer?
- should research the history of how they have improved GC
- didn't know go does not have poitner arithmetic operations
  - meaning, it cannot really go into the low-low level programming with severe performance requirements on mind
  - will have to choose something else like rust, c++
