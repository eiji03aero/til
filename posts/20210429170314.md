# Formula
## Definition
- constraints:
  - a > 0
  - a !== 1
  - M > 0
- formula:
  - loga M = p <=> M = a^p

## Formula
- constraints:
  - a > 0
  - a !== 1
  - M > 0
  - N > 0
- nature 1:
  - loga 1 = 0
- nature 2:
  - loga a = 1
- multiplication
  - loga MN = loga M + loga N
- division
  - loga M/N = loga M - loga N
- exponentiation
  - loga M^r = r loga M
    - r to be real number

## Converting base
- constraints:
  - a,b,c to be positive integer
  - a, c !== 1
- converting base
  - loga b = logc b / logc a

## Common logarithm
- is a logarithm with base equals to 10
- also known as decimal logarithm
- eg log(1000) = 3
  - 10 ^ 3 = 1000

# Explanation
- example 1:
  - log2 8 = 3
  - 2 ... base
  - 3 ... logarithm
  - 8 ... antilogarithm

# Big O notation
- constraints:
  - n ... size of input
- Constant running time
  - O(1)
  - runtime (time, space complexity) is always same regardless of n
- Logarithmic algorithm
  - O(logn)
  - runtime grows logarithmically in proportion to n
  - eg) binary search
- Linear algorithm
  - O(n)
  - runtime grows directly in proportion to n
  - eg) linear search
- Superlinear algorithm
  - O(nlogn)
  - runtime grows in proportion to n
  - eg) heap sort, merge sort
- Polynominal algorithm
  - O(n^c)
  - runtime grows quicker than previous all based on n
  - eg) bubble sort, selection sort, insertion sort
- Exponential algorithm
  - O(c^n)
  - runtime grows even faster than polynomial algorithm based on n
  - eg) tower of hanoi
- Factorial algorithm
  - O(n!)
  - runtime grows the fastest and becomes quickly unusable for even small values of n
  - eg) Determinant Expansion by Minors, Brute force Search algorithm for Traveling Salesman Problem
