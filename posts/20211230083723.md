# Summary
- go is a programming language that aims to solve problems in software development at scale
  - it is not a language to R&D programming language itself.
  - it is created and designed to solve the problems:
    - scaling development team
- go is a language with three different periodical perspectives on mind
  - past:
    - its design is developed based on creators' and maintainers' past experience (c language, unix, utf-8)
  - current: 
    - trying to provide the features that solve problems present
  - future:
    - trying to develop the language with what will be desired in future in mind
- goals of go
  - scalable as software development
    - pursuing simplicity
    - provide tools which is convention over configuration, consistency even across different workplace
    - combines two different kinds
      - feel of writing codes like interpreted language
        - compiles fast
        - type inference
        - garbage collection
      - benefits of compiled language
        - program is protected by being statically typed
        - emits executable which runs fast
  - scalable as software proogram
    - features to make most of multi-core machines
    - emits code which executes fast
- to become gopher
  - follow conventions (linter, formatter, other official tools)
  - read effective go
- powerful features of go
  - abstraction with interface
  - builtin concurrent programming
